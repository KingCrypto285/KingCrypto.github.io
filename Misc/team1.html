</br>
Since AI was created it has come so far, its spread from business to our own homes. </br>
</br>
However with any big changes there are always consequences. In AIâ€™s cases the consequences are quite high with people using the technology with malicious intent.</br> 
Recent examples of these consequences are of AI being used to scam people though deepfakes and password guessing. This was done through people using AI to manipulate others and not from AI itself. </br>
Fraudulent behaviour done through AI is a good example of how AI is being misused. As the technology is used to replicate human actions so having the ability to repeat actions and cut down the time to do so means that AI can do serious damage. </br>
These consequences from misusing AI are not from the technology itself but from people use.
</br>
</br>
Since AI was created in 1952 it has made great strides as it is more implemented into new technologies.</br> 
When AI was first created it was used to solve seven mathematical problems and now it has been implemented in tech like self-driving cars and robots.</br> 
To create AI it only takes a few lines of code to replicate human actions for complex problems and large amounts of data.</br>  
It makes this technology incredible  and with amazing potential.
</br>
</br>    
From these positives and negatives we need to make the right call in the future of AI.</br> 
Since this technology cannot be eradicated, we need to look into how it is being used.</br> 
We can create regulations and laws to manage the technology for future use.</br> 
I believe this technology has potential to continue to grow and do more for people.</br> 
However, if the consequences are not taken care of early then AI will be used more maliciously and do more harm.</br>
