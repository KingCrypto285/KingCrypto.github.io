		AI is a very useful tool. It basically functions as a human brain with a perfect memory and really strong ability to find patterns. This means that it can fill the place of pretty much any human job requiring critical thinking. Like any tool, it can be used for both good and bad. It’s usage depends purely on a user’s moral compass and their capability of using AI.
	</p>
	<p>
		Similar to a hammer, AI could easily hurt users in accidental situations (e.g. malfunctioning AI could cause a self-driving car to crash). Unlike a hammer, however, AI has the potential to impact people on a much larger scale if misused (car accident vs a sore thumb). 
	</p>
	<p>
		While existing laws clearly outlaw any kind of malicious use, this is unlikely to deter every criminal. Since AI has huge damage potential, it is probably wise that access to the technology be regulated more carefully than a hammer in a hardware store. In regards to damage that may be caused by malfunctioning AI, strict testing should be mandatory and a certification system should be used to ensure that each time AI is employed, the product is safe for use and stable. Certification would also aid consumers in choosing safer products.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because of it’s wide applicability, AI has the potential to destroy millions of jobs. Unemployment is something to be concerned about when considering switching to AI alternatives. Governments should look to balance the economics of this, looking for ways to reduce the impact of AI on unemployment levels. This could be in the form of subsidies to companies not using AI or helping people switch jobs to industries where AI is less suitable.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the long run, there is the risk that AI could replace humans. Since a fully self governable robot could be unpredictable and dangerous, some sort of failsafe system should be built in and the AI itself should be closely monitored for any concerning signs.
