<h3 class="h2_center">So what is the History of AI?</h3>
<div class="row">
<p class="P1">
	In 1955 Allen Newell and Herbert A Simon created the first artificial intelligence program called the Logical Theorist.</br> 
	This program’s purpose was to deal with complex mathematical problems and prove theorems, this program successfully proved 38 of 54 theorems.</br>  
	The logical theorist proved that a machine could work like a human and a base for AI future programming.</br>
</br>
	During  1956, the term  “Artificial Intelligence”  was created by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth conference, this was the first time that AI became a part of the academic field.</br>
</br>
	In 1966, researchers started emphasizing on developing algorithms that can solve mathematical problems, around this time the AI started to grow and take off as many researchers started looking into ways to use and implement AI.</br>
</br>
	During 1980 Expert systems were implemented into AI, this allowed the AI’s programming to simulate decision making abilities of a human expert.</br>
</br>	
	In 2002 AI was first brought into the home with the Roomba vacuum.</br>
</br>
	During 2006 AI started to be implemented into the business world by companies like Facebook, Twitter and Netflix.</br>

<h3 class="h2_center">How does it work?</h3>
<p class="h4_titles">AI consists of three sections:</p>
<div class="row">

	<h4 class="h4_titles column-underline" style="text-align: left; ">Machine Learning</h4>
	<div class="col-sm-6">
	<p class="P1">
		<i>“Machine learning  is an application of artificial intelligence  that provides 
		systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
		programmed”</i> </br>
		(What is machine learning? A definition - Expert system. (2020, October 20))
	</br></br>
	Machine learning can access data and use it to learn, this starts with the observation of data through experiences and instructions.</br> 
	Through this process, machine learning allows the computer to learn automatically   to pick up on patterns  and to make better future decisions.</br> 
</br></br></p>
<p class="P1">	Machine learning works on the below algorithms:</br>

<i>Supervised machine learning algorithms:</i></br>
These algorithms can be used by taking the information from past instructions, being applied to new data from labelled examples to predict future events. </br>
This algorithm starts with analysing a known dataset, from there the algorithm produces a function that helps predict output values.After sufficient training, the computer is then able to provide targets of any  inserted data. </br>
This algorithm can then compare its result to  any correct results, so it can be compared and modify the system accordingly.</br>
</br>
<i>Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms</i></br>
Semi-supervised machine learning algorithms is a mix between the supervised and unsupervised  machine learning algorithms. </br>
The purpose of this algorithm is to use both unlabelled and labelled data, this allows the system to considerably improve learning accuracy.This is only used when the data requires skilled and relevant resources to train it.</br>
</br>
<i>Unsupervised machine learning algorithms </i></br>
This type of algorithm is used only when the  example data is neither labelled or defined. </br>
Having unsupervised machine learning algorithms shows how the system can infer a function over the unlabelled data.</br>
This algorithm will not provide result data, but instead show how all the inputted data is related.</br>
</br>
</br>
<i>Reinforced Machine learning algorithms:</i></br>
This algorithm interacts with its environment by producing actions and discovering errors and rewards.</br>
This allows the system to determine the ideal behaviour in a specific context to maximise the performance.</br>

			<i>“Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, 
			algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data”</i></br>
			((n.d.). Forbes.). 
		</br></br>
		Deep learning  uses a neural network  to repeat a task multiple times, with each time the process being twerked a little to alter the outcome. </br>
		Deep learning is able to be used in the neural network of AI, as neural networks are built on multiple layers so the repeated tasks can be accomplished without holding up the rest of the network.</br>
		A popular example of deep learning in action is CNN or (convolution neural networks), the CNN involves learned features with 2D layers that helps this architecture  suite to processing data.</br>
	    This system works by extracting the features from the image itself, so every step of the process has a function to identify the image. </br>

	<i>	“A neural network (also called an artificial neural network) is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons 	
		in a layered structure that resembles a human brain.”</i></br>
		(What is a neural network? (n.d.))
	</br></br>
	The neural network combines multiple processing  layers  with simple elements operating in parallel. The network consists of an input layer, an output layer and multiple hidden layers.</br> 
	This works with AI  by allowing the layers to be used to transfer multiple signals across the system to process the algorithms. This system mimics how the nervous system works and is inspired by it.</br>

	<h4 class="h4_titles">Expert Systems</h4>
	<p class="P1">
		A large part of AI is the use and inclusion of an expert system.</br>
	</br>
		“Expert systems have specific knowledge to one problem domain” (Moné L, (2018, January 18)), this means that the expert system consists of knowledge that is related to people who use it ie. medicine, science, engineering.</br> 
		The knowledge is loaded from the expert system’s knowledge base, this contains all information regarding the subject. This information can be updated and removed along with new information can also be loaded into the system.</br> 
		AI uses expert systems as a reference of information, this allows it to pull up relevant information to solve problems.</br>
</br>
By having the ability to pull up relevant and usefull information, an AI system can help solve complex problems and sort through large amounts of data in quick time.
