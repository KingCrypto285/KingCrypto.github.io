<h2 class="h2_center">“seeks to do make computers do the sorts of things that minds can do”( Boden, M. A. (2016)), </h2>

<div class="row">
	<p class="P1" style="text-align: center;">
		We chose the risks and opportunities of AI, along with the uses and misuses of this technology.</br>
		AI (Artifical Intelligence) is the use of programs to accomplish tasks that people do, we saw chose this technology as it is so facinating.</br>
		AI is built on hundreds of lines of code that can replicate human interactions, this allows complex problems and large amounts of data to be sorted in faster times.

<h3 class="h2_center">So what is the History of AI?</h3>
<div class="row">
<p class="P1">
	In 1955 Allen Newell and Herbert A Simon created the first artificial intelligence program called the Logical Theorist.</br> 
	This program’s purpose was to deal with complex mathematical problems and prove theorems, this program successfully proved 38 of 54 theorems.</br>  
	The logical theorist proved that a machine could work like a human and a base for AI future programming.</br>
</br>
	During  1956, the term  “Artificial Intelligence”  was created by John McCarthy at the Dartmouth conference, this was the first time that AI became a part of the academic field.</br>
	In 1966, researchers started emphasizing on developing algorithms that can solve mathematical problems, around this time the AI started to grow and take off as many researchers started looking into ways to use and implement AI.</br>
	During 1980 Expert systems were implemented into AI, this allowed the AI’s programming to simulate decision making abilities of a human expert.</br>

</div>
<hr/>
<h3 class="h2_center">How does it work?</h3>
<p class="P1">AI consists of three sections:</p>
<div class="row">

	<h4 class="h4_titles" style="text-align: left; ">Machine Learning</h4>
	<p class="P1">
		<i>“Machine learning  is an application of artificial intelligence  that provides 
		systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly 
		programmed”</i> </br>
		(What is machine learning? A definition - Expert system. (2020, October 20))
	</br></br>
	Machine learning can access data and use it to learn, this starts with the observation of data through experiences and instructions.</br> 
	Through this process, machine learning allows the computer to learn automatically   to pick up on patterns  and to make better future decisions.</br> 
</br></br></p>
<p class="P1">	Machine learning works on the below algorithms:</br>
Supervised machine learning algorithms:</br>
These algorithms can be used by taking the information from past instructions, being applied to new data from labelled examples to predict future events. </br>
This algorithm starts with analysing a known dataset, from there the algorithm produces a function that helps predict output values.After sufficient training, the computer is then able to provide targets of any  inserted data. </br>
This algorithm can then compare its result to  any correct results, so it can be compared and modify the system accordingly.</br>

</p>

</div>
<div class="row">
	
		<h4 class="h4_titles"  style="text-align: left;">Deep Learning</h4>
		<p class="P1" >
			<i>“Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, 
			algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data”</i></br>
			((n.d.). Forbes.). 
		</br></br>
		Deep learning  uses a neural network  to repeat a task multiple times, with each time the process being twerked a little to alter the outcome. </br>
		Deep learning is able to be used in the neural network of AI, as neural networks are built on multiple layers so the repeated tasks can be accomplished without holding up the rest of the network.</br>
		A popular example of deep learning in action is CNN or (convolution neural networks), the CNN involves learned features with 2D layers that helps this architecture  suite to processing data.</br>
	    This system works by extracting the features from the image itself, so every step of the process has a function to identify the image. </br>
	   
		</p>
	
</div>


<div class="row">
	<h4 class="h4_titles">Neural Network</h4>
	<p class="P1">
	<i>	“A neural network (also called an artificial neural network) is an adaptive system that learns by using interconnected nodes or neurons 	
		in a layered structure that resembles a human brain.”</i></br>
		(What is a neural network? (n.d.))
	</br></br>
	The neural network combines multiple processing  layers  with simple elements operating in parallel. The network consists of an input layer, an output layer and multiple hidden layers.</br> 
	This works with AI  by allowing the layers to be used to transfer multiple signals across the system to process the algorithms. This system mimics how the nervous system works and is inspired by it.</br>
